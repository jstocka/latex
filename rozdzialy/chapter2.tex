Before one needs to understand what exactly is behind the term "rhythm game" one needs to understand the history and heritage of the genre. The first game to introduce a gameplay that somehow resembles part of mechanics of contemporary rhythm games is Simon created in 1978 by Ralph Baer and Howard Morrison. In that computer handheld game, the player needs to repeat the sentence in which the buttons light up. The sequence becomes progressively longer, up to the point where a player is unable to repeat it in the right order. There was no background music to it to speak of, so it cannot be considered a fully-fledged rhythm game, but the action of repeating sequences and patterns is a fundamental part of present-day rhythm games genre.

\end{figure}

The first rhythm game that can be recognized as such is PaRappa the Rapper (1996) published by Sony Computer Entertainment for PlayStation platform, building its core gameplay around music. Because of its unique art style, good narrative and catchy soundtrack, the game was well received among the players and critics, listed as one of the best video games ever made several times. \cite{acclaimed_videogames_parappa} This success contributed significantly to the rise in popularity of the genre. In the PaRappa the Rapper gameplay, the player must press correct buttons in response to the rhythm of currently playing track and symbols that appear on the top of the screen. The correct sequence is first performed by a teacher, after which PaRappa needs to respond accordingly. Pressing the correct buttons in accordance to the rhythm results in PaRappa rapping. One can observe the resemblance to aforementioned Simon electronic game -– PaRappa built upon this mechanic, adding additional visual and  auditory feedback, background music and grading system, setting the stage for further developments of this genre. Especially important was the addition of background music synced with other gameplay elements, making it easier to time the hits correctly. The player's final accuracy in graded from Awful to Cool –- this is currently a standard, expected element of every representant of the genre. The score is affected not only by omitted hits, but also less-than-ideal hits - the more accurate the hit, the better the rating.

The release of Beatmania in 1997 by Konami was another milestone in the development of rhythm games genre. To enhance the player's experience with a more immersive input device, the game was introduced to Japanese arcades instead of releasing it on home platforms. Beatmania's arcade cabinet include a special input device which resemble a DJ console -– it consists of 5 buttons arranged in a piano-like pattern and round pad that mimic a vinyl record. 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{obrazki/beatmaniacontrols.jpg}
    \caption{A controller of 1st Beatmania arcade release, showing the buttons layout and the turntable. \cite{beatmaniacontrols}}
    \label{fig:beatmania_controls}
\end{figure}

The gameplay is enclosed on a stage that consists of a vertically-scrolling panel with hit-notes on the sides, music video and audience bar in the middle. The player is supposed to press the buttons and turn the turntable accordingly with the notes that are falling from the top to the bottom of the screen, indicating the time to react when they fall down on the judgement line above illustration of the controller. This is currently known as vertical scrolling rhythm game -– which PaRappa the Rapper could not be considered as such because it showed the input sequences in batches. The game turned out to be a big hit, resulting in Konami putting more effort and resources into Konami's Games and Music Division. Due to the success of Beatmania, this department changed its name to Bemani paying respects to its prior game title. \cite{musicbasedgames} After exploring with more concepts of rhythm games, they came up with another big hit, which was Dance Dance Revolution (1998) -– pioneering title in the rhythm game genre. It adapted the basic concept of vertical scrolling rhythm game to a new form of input. The game is controlled through a dance platform, with the player standing in the middle and pressing the buttons with their feet.

The core gameplay is very akin to beatmania, sans the turntable. The VSRG formula has been adapted to a new type of play with player in standing position, dancing to the upcoming rhythm notes. This small change resulted in an experience unlike anything before, as following the patterns became even more natural and dancing became a natural result of playing the game properly.  The game became an even bigger success than beatmania, achieving worldwide popularity, being an introduction to the rhythm game genre for many players around the world. A major factor in this was definitely a natural connection between its input method and gameplay revolving around dancing.

Taking these games as examples, the core gameplay of all rhythm games is based on performing an action accordingly to the music's rhythm and displayed pattern. It can be defined that a rhythm game is a medium that puts strong emphasis on a player's rhythm sense, coordination and reflexes. Another staple of the medium is often a presence of a custom controller, as demonstrated by beatmania and Dance Dance Revolution. This stays true to this day -– BEMANI is still publishing new installments of those franchises as of 2024, as well as other rhythm games that incorporate all aforementioned mechanics. An example of other immensely popular series featuring such would be Activision's Guitar Hero series that successfully ported the arcade experience onto the living room, bundling the game with the controller starting on the 6th generation of video game consoles.

\section{Further developments}
Consecutively, rhythm games were released to both arcades and other platforms, such as home and handheld consoles or PCs. In order to relocate the experience of arcade booths into home, input devices of arcade games were adapted into home versions of dedicated controllers. For example, an open-source project StepMania, which is both a PC game and game engine at the same time, was developed with the purpose of replicating the Dance Dance Revolution experience at home. It can be played with keyboard or dance pads matching the pattern of DDR, or alternatively following Pump It Up! (Andamiro) controls -– a dance game with 4 buttons placed diagonally and one extra button in the middle.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \label{fig:ddr_softpad}
\end{figure}

In the present day, there are many popular PC games that do not require any dedicated controllers or input devices, making it easier to entry the genre with basic gaming setup. Games such as StepMania, osu! or DJMAX, have online scoreboards and online multiplayer modes, that bring players together and create lively communities, making the competitive nature as a natural part of their gameplay and purpose for players.

On the other hand, there are many arcade games that have unique controllers with various forms. 
One of such arcade game that is worth mentioning is WACCA, developed published by Marvelous which was created in collaboration with HARDCORE TANO*C, released in 2020. The game's user interface is enclosed in a circle, surrounded by a circular, segmented ring panel on the screen edges. The notes are appearing on the center screen, approaching the player through the ring panels. Because it's fun form somehow resembling a washing machine drum, this game stands out from other rhythm game arcades, as it's financially unviable to port to a home console or a PC due to this control and gameplay.

The genre of rhythm games also has an immense value as educational tool, as showed through the release of Rocksmith by Ubisoft. Instead of using a fake plastic controller, the game allows the player to plug in any real electronic guitar, making it the center point of the game. The game's interface is similar to Guitar Hero's stage, but approaching notes are more specific in order to instruct player what grips and strings are supposed to be used. Due to using a real guitar instead of plastic device, the game was received as great development milestone in the genre, highlighted by the educational value provided by playing on an actual instrument, as creating a digital rhythm game with real instruments as an input device was a notable achievement for the genre. The game is developed to this day in form of Rocksmith+ -- a free-to-play title available on PC, monetized through in-app purchases of songs and lessons.

As Fayali Kares stated in his thesis "Playing Music: Design, Theory, and Practice of Music-based Games" \cite{fayeskayali}:

    Overall, rhythm games have changed very little over time. The only changes Harmonix made to the much older Konami games concerned perspective and direct control of the underlying soundtrack. Distinction between rhythm games revolves mostly around the different input devices. From floor mats in DDR, to turntables or guitars, a variety of interfaces have found their way into the homes of rhythm game fans.

Noteworthy, despite the fact that all rhythm games have similar core gameplay, with the development of technology this genre has been able to expand the player experience through the use of new input devices and unique approach to the gameplay. With the rise of such technologies as virtual reality or touch screens, rhythm game developers have utilized new solutions in order to create new experiences. Because of this, the creativity of game designers is no longer limited as it was in the past.
