\section*{Abstract}
\noindent
The paper examines the impact of rhythm game mechanics on the sense of immersion present in rhythm games and the initiation of a flow state in the player. The research methods include an evaluation of the history of the genre, the competitive aspect present in games, selected mechanics in the representatives of the genre and the visual, auditory and tactile feedback systems present in them. By performing case studies of selected games, the key findings demonstrate the joint effect and symbiosis of the mentioned factors on the process of achieving a state of flow and player engagement. The possibilities of adjustments of the game objective, level of difficulty and variety of songs in rhythm games further enhance this state. Social and cultural factors common in the representatives of the genre are also strengthening in this aspect. The conclusion of the thesis points to the satisfying entertainment loop and rewarding feedback, intrinsically building engagement and flow, as a major factor in the appeal of the rhythm game genre.
